## Contributions and Comments
This project is a slow-moving "labor-of-love" for our group and intended additional features are worked on sporadically based upon need, time, and our ability to deal with Apple's poor documentation.  Currently, the bulk of our efforts are put into SwiftVISASwift (https://github.com/SwiftVISA/SwiftVISASwift).  We would love help and please e-mail me (or to reply to the relevant issue or open a new one).
